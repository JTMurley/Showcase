This Git Reposistory displays some of the cool things that I have done as apart of my university degree (Bachelor of Computer Science) as well as some of the things that I've made when bored of doing university work.

The display ranges from code to reports to major projects on a range of topcis that are mathmatical graph based problems to vectors in 3D planes for robotics to a UCD breakdown of CAV's website as well as alot of code from alot of different projects.

Currently I have two branches (I prefer the layout for this type of thing) for you to explore with more on the way (hopefully):
- Reports
- Code


## Videos
Some videos of the projects/tasks showcase can be found at the following but note I study comp sci and not audio and visual production so mind the quality! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrvA68VZDAWxJ2BbnZW891Q?view_as=subscriber
