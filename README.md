_Hi, my name's **Jack** and I make people :smile:_, I'm a practical computer scientist with proven industry experience in delivering not only what the client wants, but what they always **dreamed the application could be**. I'm currently in my final trimester of my computer science degree at Deakin University and most importantly of all, **I love to code**.

Throughout my degree I have worked in the following IT based roles:
- Systems Officer focused on EDW development from the ground up and real time data analysis
- Assoicate Research Fellow in the area of swarm robotics
- Teaching Assistant within the first year robotics unit at Deakin University, SIT122
- School of IT outreach ambassador (Interactive robotics based workshops)
- School of SEBE Student ambassador where I focus on promoting and encouraging high school aged students to study STEM

This little Git Repository displays some of the cool things that I have done as a part of my university degree (Bachelor of Computer Science) as well as some of the things that I've made when bored of doing university work because some of the time its not the most fun to do. Nevertheless, it also showcases some of my research projects.

## Visual Demonstration/Videos
Some videos of the projects/tasks showcase can be found at the following but note I study comp sci and not audio and visual production so mind the quality! - [YouTube Channel - JTMurley](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrvA68VZDAWxJ2BbnZW891Q?view_as=subscriber)

## Coding Challenges
When I get bored or just want a hard problem to solve I often go to coding challenge websites to have some fun. Some of my profiles can be found below. I also make some challenges up myself and then solve them and post them onto the website itself, currently I only do this on the edabit platform.

## Power Bi Dashbaords
A significant area of interest of mine lately has been reporting tools, more specifically building dashboards. Why? The immense power and benefit they can provide to companies in todays digital workplace when paired with the correct tools such as Power Bi and Tableau. Nevertheless, some sample dashboards I have made public can be seen below (note QnA does not work when published public):
