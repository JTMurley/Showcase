_My name's **Jack**_, I'm currently in my final year of my computer science degree and work as an **Associate Research Fellow (Swarm robotics)** at Deakin University with a interest in not only Robotics :robot: but also ITBM systems like service now and CRM systems as well as embedded IOT technology. However my true passion is in the field of autonomous node/robotic scalability based off of the sense think act paradigm.

Throughout my degree I have worked in the following IT based roles:
- Assoicate Research Fellow in the area of swarm robotics
- Teaching Assistant within the first year robotics unit at Deakin University, SIT122
- School of IT outreach ambassador where I primarily teach robotics to school aged children between 5 and 18 years of age
- School of SEBE Student ambassador where I focus on promoting and encouraging high school aged students to study STEM

This little Git Reposistory displays some of the cool things that I have done as apart of my university degree (Bachelor of Computer Science) as well as some of the things that I've made when bored of doing university work because some of the time its not the most fun to do. Nevertheless, it also showcases some of my research projects.

This small display of my work ranges from specific unique code I have written to reports then to major projects on a range of topcis that are mathmatical graph based problems to vectors in 3D planes for robotics and then a complete reverse to having a UCD breakdown of CAV's website as well as alot of code from alot of different projects.

Currently I have three branches (I prefer the layout for this type of thing) for you to explore:
- [Reports](https://github.com/JTMurley/Showcase/tree/Reports) :book:
- [Code](https://github.com/JTMurley/Showcase/tree/Code) :atom: 
- [Research](https://github.com/JTMurley/Showcase/blob/Research/README.md) :mortar_board:


## Visual Demonstration/Videos
Some videos of the projects/tasks showcase can be found at the following but note I study comp sci and not audio and visual production so mind the quality! - [YouTube Channel - JTMurley](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrvA68VZDAWxJ2BbnZW891Q?view_as=subscriber)

## Coding Challenge Websites Profiles
When I get bored or just want a hard problem to solve I often go to coding challenge websites to have some fun. Some of my profiles can be found below. I also make some challenges up myself and then solve them and post them onto the website itself, currently I only do this on the edabit platform.

## Power Bi Dashbaords
A significant area of interest of mine lately has been reporting tools, more specifically building dashboards. Why? The immense power and benifit they can provide to companies in todays digital workplace when paired with the correct tools such as Power Bi and Tableau. Nevertheless, some sample dashboards I have made public can be seen below (note QnA does not work when published public):
